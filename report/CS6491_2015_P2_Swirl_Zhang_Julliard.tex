\section{Objective}

We want to compute the mathematical formulation and the implementation of Steady Interpolating Similarity $SIS(F_a,t,F_b)$. and validate our solution by starting with user controlled frames $F_0$ and $F_1$, by extrapolating a steady pattern of frames $F_i$ such that the transformation $T$ between $F_i$ and $F_{i+1}$ is independent of $i$, and by showing (visually) that $F_i = SIS(F_0,i/k,F_k)$ for all $i$.


\section{Definitions of Entities}


A 3D frame $\{I,J,K,O\}$ is a similarity frame if all its factors have the same magnitude, if each is orthogonal to the other two, and if $(I \times J) \cdot K>0$.\\
\\
A Similarity Motion is an similarity frame $F(t)$ parameterize by time.\\
\\
The Steady Interpolating Similarity $SIS(F_a,t,F_b)$ is a Similarity Motion, such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item SIS(Fa,0,Fb)= Fa,
\item SIS(Fa,1,Fb)= Fb,
\item And the similarity transformation from SIS(Fa,t,Fb) to SIS(Fa,t+u,Fb) is independent of t,
\end{itemize}

Figure 1 shows some of the 3D swirls in nature and man-made structures.

\section{Approach}
Steady interpolating similarity motion is a combination of rotation around a fixed axis, translation along that axis, and scaling. There are many kinds of SIS motions, where rotation, translation, and scaling are different combinations. For example we have,

\subsection{Screw Motion}
Screw motion is the combination of rotation and translation. Assume the rotation is around axis $(F, N)$, initial point $P_0$, unit time rotation angle $\alpha$, speed along the axis is constant $d$, we can describe the screw motion as:
\begin{equation}
P(t) = F + FP_0^o(t\alpha) + dtN
\end{equation}
\#FIND ART\#

\subsection{Spiral Motion}
Spiral motion is the combination of rotation and scaling. One common spiral motion is log spiral. Assume the the rotation is around axis $(F, N)$, initial point $P_0$, unit time rotation angle $\alpha$, scaling factor is exponential of $m$, we can describe the log spiral motion as:
\begin{equation}
P(t) = F + m^t FP_0^o(t\alpha)
\end{equation}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Swirl Motion}
Swirl motion is the combination (``commutatie composition'') of log spiral motion around an axis and exponential translation along the axis. Assume the the rotation is around axis $(F, N)$, initial point $P_0$, unit time rotation angle $\alpha$, scaling factor is exponential of $m$, velocity along the axis is exponential of $d$, we can describe the log spiral motion as:
\begin{equation}
P(t) = F + m^t FP_0^o(t\alpha, N) + d^t N
\end{equation}
\#FIND ART\#

\section{Implementation}


\subsection{Computing $N$}

For computing the $N$ from similarity frames $F_0(O_0,I_0,J_0,K_0)$ and $F_1(O_1,I_1,J_1,K_1)$, we can derive $N$ as
\begin{equation}
N = \frac{\Delta I \times \Delta J + \Delta J \times \Delta K + \Delta K \times \Delta I}{3}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta I = I_1 - I_0$, $\Delta J = J_1 - J_0$, $\Delta K = K_1 - K_0$.

Note that we only derived the vector ot $N$, without knowing which point the axis $N$ pass through. We can project $F_0$ and $F_1$ on any plane perpenticular to $N$, thus the question becomes to solve the center $F'$ of a spiral motion, which $N$ will pass through.


\subsection{Computing $F$}
For computing the $F$ from $F_0$ and $F_1$, suppose we are given the input the same as above, we get
\begin{equation}
A = F + FA
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
D = F + FA^o (t\alpha, N) m^t + d^t N
\end{equation}
Therefore we can derive $F$ by
\begin{equation}
A^o (t\alpha, N) m^t + d^t N - D = F^o (t\alpha, N) m^t - F
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
d^t = FD \cdot N - FA \cdot N 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
m^t = \frac{FD - (FD \cdot N) N }{FA - (FA \cdot N) N}
\end{equation}
And rotating an arbitary point around an axis can be done by (\cite{murray13}): 

(1) Translate space so that the rotation axis passes through the origin.

(2) Rotate space about the z axis so that the rotation axis lies in the xz plane.

(3) Rotate space about the y axis so that the rotation axis lies along the z axis.

(4) Perform the desired rotation by θ about the z axis.

(5) Apply the inverse of step (3).

(6) Apply the inverse of step (2).

(7) Apply the inverse of step (1).

\subsection{Computing $F_i$ from $F_0$ and $F_1$ in 3D}
If we know $F$, $F_0$, and $F_1$, we know the swirl motion description $P(t) = F + m^t FP_0^o(t\alpha, N) + d^t N$, so we can interpolate each frame simply by changing $t$ to $2t$, $3t$, $\ldots$, $kt$.
