\section{Objective}

We want to compute the mathematical formulation and the implementation of Steady Interpolating Similarity $SIS(F_a,t,F_b)$. and validate our solution by starting with user controlled frames $F_0$ and $F_1$, by extrapolating a steady pattern of frames $F_i$ such that the transformation $T$ between $F_i$ and $F_{i+1}$ is independent of $i$, and by showing (visually) that $F_i = SIS(F_0,i/k,F_k)$ for all $i$.


\section{Definitions of Entities}


A 3D frame $\{I,J,K,O\}$ is a similarity frame if all its factors have the same magnitude, if each is orthogonal to the other two, and if $(I \times J)ÂŸ \cdot K>0$.\\
\\
A Similarity Motion is an similarity frame $F(t)$ parameterize by time.\\
\\
The Steady Interpolating Similarity $SIS(F_a,t,F_b)$ is a Similarity Motion, such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item SIS(Fa,0,Fb)= Fa,
\item SIS(Fa,1,Fb)= Fb,
\item And the similarity transformation from SIS(Fa,t,Fb) to SIS(Fa,t+u,Fb) is independent of t,
\end{itemize}

\section{Approach}
Steady interpolating similarity motion is a combination of rotation around a fixed axis, translation along that axis, and scaling. There are many kinds of SIS motions, where rotation, translation, and scaling are different combinations. For example we have,

\subsection{Screw Motion}
Screw motion is the combination of rotation and translation. Assume the rotation is around axis $(F, N)$, initial point $P_0$, unit time rotation angle $\alpha$, speed along the axis is constant $d$, we can describe the screw motion as:
\begin{equation}
P(t) = F + FP_0^o(t\alpha) + dtN
\end{equation}
\#FIND ART\#

\subsection{Spiral Motion}
Spiral motion is the combination of rotation and scaling. One common spiral motion is log spiral. Assume the the rotation is around axis $(F, N)$, initial point $P_0$, unit time rotation angle $\alpha$, scaling factor is exponential of $m$, we can describe the log spiral motion as:
\begin{equation}
P(t) = F + m^t FP_0^o(t\alpha)
\end{equation}
\#FIND ART\#

\subsection{Swirl Motion}
Swirl motion is the combination (``commutatie composition'') of log spiral motion around an axis and exponential translation along the axis. Assume the the rotation is around axis $(F, N)$, initial point $P_0$, unit time rotation angle $\alpha$, scaling factor is exponential of $m$, velocity along the axis is exponential of $d$, we can describe the log spiral motion as:
\begin{equation}
P(t) = F + m^t FP_0^o(t\alpha, N) + d^t N
\end{equation}
\#FIND ART\#

\subsection{Computing $N$}

For computing the $N$ from $F_0$ and $F_1$, suppose we are given the input of the coordinates $(I_0, J_0, K_0)$ and $(I_1, J_1, K_1)$ and assume the angular velocity around the axis is constant, we can derive $N$ as
\begin{equation}
N = \frac{\Delta I \times \Delta J + \Delta J \times \Delta K + \Delta I \times \Delta K}{3}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta I = I_1 - I_0$, $\Delta J = J_1 - J_0$, $\Delta K = K_1 - K_0$.
